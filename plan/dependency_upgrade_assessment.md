# Dependency Upgrade Assessment - Task Dashboard

**Date**: 2025-07-04  
**Status**: Critical security vulnerabilities identified  

## Executive Summary

The Task Dashboard application has several outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities that need attention. Most critical is a moderate severity vulnerability in the Vite development server that could expose the application to security risks during development.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Vite/ESBuild Security Issue (MODERATE SEVERITY)
- **Current**: Vite 3.2.11 with vulnerable esbuild
- **Issue**: Development server can receive/respond to any website requests
- **Advisory**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Fix Required**: Upgrade to Vite 7.0.2 (breaking change)

### 2. Go Security Updates
- **golang.org/x/crypto**: v0.33.0 → v0.39.0
- **golang.org/x/net**: v0.35.0 → v0.41.0  
- **golang.org/x/sys**: v0.30.0 → v0.33.0

## Major Version Upgrades Needed

### Frontend Dependencies
| Package | Current | Latest | Breaking Change | Priority |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| React | 18.3.1 | 19.1.0 | Yes | High |
| TypeScript | 4.9.5 | 5.8.3 | Yes | High |
| Vite | 3.2.11 | 7.0.2 | Yes | Critical |
| @vitejs/plugin-react | 2.2.0 | 4.6.0 | Yes | Critical |
| Tailwind CSS | 3.4.17 | 4.1.11 | Yes | Medium |

### Key Risks
1. **React 19**: New rendering behavior, possible hook API changes
2. **TypeScript 5**: Stricter type checking may reveal hidden issues
3. **Vite 7**: Configuration format changes, plugin compatibility
4. **Tailwind 4**: CSS class naming changes

## Recommended Upgrade Path

### Phase 1: Security (1-2 hours)
1. Update Go security packages (low risk)
2. Create isolated branch for Vite upgrade testing

### Phase 2: Core Updates (4-6 hours)
1. TypeScript 4→5 (test build process)
2. React 18→19 (test all components)
3. Vite 3→7 with plugin updates

### Phase 3: Polish (2-3 hours)
1. Update type definitions
2. Update Tailwind CSS
3. Full regression testing

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Security Audit**: Run `npm audit` regularly
2. **Branch Strategy**: Create upgrade branches for testing
3. **Rollback Plan**: Tag current stable version before upgrades
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite before/after each phase

## Alternative Approach (Time Constrained)

If full upgrades aren't feasible immediately:
1. Apply security patches only where possible
2. Schedule major upgrades for next sprint
3. Consider using npm overrides for critical security fixes
4. Implement dependency update automation (Dependabot)

## Conclusion

While the application currently functions well, the security vulnerabilities and outdated dependencies pose increasing risk over time. A phased upgrade approach minimizing breaking changes is recommended, starting with security patches and proceeding to major version updates as time permits.
